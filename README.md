# Utilities
Here I keep interesting utilities that I once had to write

The "Coder & Decoders" folder contains the base64 encoder. Hamming Code encoders and decoders. The decoder of the gamma code of Elias.

The "FUN" folder contains an attempt to implement Rijndael, and a comic decoder for the Siberian cipher.
UPD: also "FUN" folder contains an implementations of RLE encoding
