# Utilities
Here I have collected some of the scripts that I once wrote and that I have left.
The "Coder & Decoders" folder contains the base64 encoder. Hamming Code encoders and decoders. The decoder of the gamma code of Elias.
The "FUN" folder contains an attempt to implement Rijndael, and a comic decoder for the Siberian cipher.
